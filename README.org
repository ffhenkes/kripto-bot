* Kripto Bot

This is a simple bot to login and query kripto generating a file containing all secrets in order to export for a particular service.

The idea here is to use a binary with user and password compiled within without exposing kripto user and password to the outside world.

Kripto Bot accept via environment variables user and password that should be built in the final binary.

The suggested strategy is to secure those variables in a CI mechanism and use it to build the bot, after that use the bot to request the variables from kripto and export it.

The script *kshell.sh* is an usage example.

** Build

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
make build
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Run example

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
make run
#+END_EXAMPLE
